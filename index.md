# Summer Website


## Introduction


**Hello.** This is mt github pages website where I am trying out making a markdown website. I looked up trying to use *Jekyll* but it seemed like a lot of hoops to jump through.

## Content


I am more familiar with html than I am with markdown but I can give it a shot. ~~It does not seem that bad~~

Some languages and technologies I am thinking of learning

- Django because it is a python based way of building websites
- SQL as it is good for databases

>I can also try out Jekyll more later by watching a tutorial.

Here I am trying out some of the markdown features.



I made this code on GitHub directly instead of using `git init` and uploading the files from my computer.

That would have needed

```
git add *
git commit -m '[your commit message here]'
git push

```


Color models test `#ccafbc`
This does not seem to work as intended

To do list

- [x] create github pages website
- [x] add content
- [ ] set up local repo

Thoughts on this assignment
1. This reminds me of when I needed to use some markdown cells when making a project on Google Colab
2. I do wonder what the Jekyll templates are like
